## Task and Motion Planning with CDS Learned from Demonstrations
This repository includes the packages and instructions to run the LASA Motion planning architecture developed initially for a pizza dough rolling task within the Robohow project, but can be used for any task and any type of controller that outputs the desired command in task space (i.e. desired cartesian pose/ft/stiffness)

This research was conducted in the Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory (LASA) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) under the supervision of Prof. Aude Billard.  ---- http://lasa.epfl.ch/

It was funded by the EU Project ROBOHOW.COG. ----https://robohow.eu/

### Modular Architecture Description:
![alt tag](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/task-motion-planning-cds/blob/bare/img/lasa-architecture.png)

Following a brief run-through of the architecture:

  - **Action  planner:** The  action  planner  tells  theMotion  planner which  learned  action  to execute and the corresponding attractor obtained from the vision module (or fixed values insimulation).
  - **Vision Module (dough/attractor detectors):** This is the vision module, which detects the attractors for each corresponding action in the sequence or single action involved in the desired task.  (This module can be substituted by fixed values to facilitate simulation and fast integration of new components.)
  - **Motion planner:** Executes the requested action from the Action planner.This involves commanding the next desired state of the end-effector (pose, force/torque) using the currentstate of the end-effector and the parameters learned for the specifc action (i.e.  parameters of Coupled-Dynamical-System for pose control, parameters of probability distribution functionfor force/torque, stiffness profile) until the attractor/force is reached.
  - **EPFL  Task  Models:** These  are  text  files  that  contain  the  parameters  for  the  learnedaction/motion for each task.
  - **Cartesian to Joint State Transformer:** This module takes the desired end-effector com-mand (pose, force/torque) and converts it to joint velocities and stiffness. --- (Using IKSolver implemented in [robot-toolkit](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/robot-toolkit)) ---
  - **Joint to Cartesian State Estimator:** This module estimates the end-effector pose and force/torque from the joint angle/torques provided by the low-level controller. --- (Using FwdKinematics implemented in [robot-toolkit](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/robot-toolkit))) ---
  
### Usage in your own projects:
Using this **modular architecture**, one can easily simulate and test their own controllers and experiments. As the modules are not tied to each other, one can implement their own motion planner/policy controller in task space and execute it on a simulation or on a real robot with only using the corresponding topics, the state transformers/simulator or kuka_fri_bridge will take care of the rest. An example of these module being used to simulate and control actions can be found in this package:  [kuka_planning_interface ](https://github.com/nbfigueroa/kuka_planning_interface)

Also, if one chooses to use their own inverse kinematics/dynamics solvers on can send topics directly to the kuka_fri_bridge which works as a bridge to the KUKA control box.
